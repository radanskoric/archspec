# How It Works

After reading this guide, you will know:

- The six stages between your source code and a diagnostic.
- What facts ArchSpec extracts and what it refuses to guess.
- Why checks are fast and safe to run anywhere.

## The Pipeline

`archspec check` never loads or executes your application. [Rubydex](https://github.com/Shopify/rubydex)
builds a resolved semantic index, while [Prism](https://github.com/ruby/prism)
records the few facts whose exact syntax matters. Everything downstream is
plain data:

```text
glob files -> parse syntax -> resolve semantics -> merge facts -> assign components -> evaluate rules
```

The optional [`archspec reflect` command]({% link _guides/association-reflection.md %})
boots Rails separately to record resolved association facts. Checks consume
those snapshots as data and reject them when their source inputs change.

1. **Collect.** The patterns from `source` (defaulting to `app/**/*.rb`,
   `lib/**/*.rb`, and pack/engine paths) are globbed from the project
   directory, minus `ignore` patterns. (`Analyzer.source_files`)
2. **Parse syntax.** Each file goes through `Prism.parse_file`. Syntax errors
   become `parser.syntax` diagnostics instead of crashes, and
   `archspec:disable` comments are collected as suppressions.
3. **Resolve semantics.** Rubydex indexes exactly those files and resolves
   declarations, constants, ancestors, methods, and aliases.
   (`RubydexIndex`)
4. **Merge facts.** The Prism overlay adds literal `require` calls, dynamic
   syntax, framework macros, and other source-shape facts Rubydex does not
   expose. (`Analyzer::SyntaxOverlay`)
5. **Assign components.** Each `component` declaration claims files by glob,
   constants by namespace/name, or classes by ancestry. `except:` subtracts
   from file globs. A file can belong to several components; the `explain`
   command shows why. (`Graph.assign_components`)
6. **Evaluate.** Every rule reads the graph and emits diagnostics, which are
   then filtered through suppressions and the todo file, sorted, and printed.
   (`Evaluator.evaluate`)

## The Facts

Everything a rule can check is one of these edge types:

| Fact                       | Recorded when                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `references_constant`      | `UsersController` appears in an expression     |
| `inherits_from`            | `class User < ApplicationRecord`               |
| `includes` / `prepends` / `extends` | `include Billable` and friends        |
| `calls_named_method`       | any method call, by name                       |
| `instantiates_and_invokes` | `UserBuilder.new(params).build`                |
| `requires` / `requires_relative` | `require "csv"` with a literal string    |
| `dynamic_feature`          | `send`, `const_get`, `define_method`, `method_missing`, ... |

Alongside edges, the graph keeps each constant's methods, signatures, aliases,
and mixins. Static constant receivers are resolved for receiver-aware method
rules without materializing RubyDEX's entire method-reference graph.

A definition is a `class` or `module` keyword, or a constant assignment.
`MAX_RETRIES = 3` defines a plain constant; assigning `Class.new`,
`Struct.new`, or `Data.define` defines a class whose block is its body, and
`Module.new` defines a module. All of them belong to components and resolve
as reference targets like any other constant.

Run `archspec explain app/models/user.rb` to see the facts for one file.
It prints the defined constants, component assignments with reasons, and
every outgoing edge, incoming dependency, and local analysis gap:

```text
app/models/user.rb

  defined constants: User
  components:
    models: matched file pattern app/models/**/*.rb
  outgoing facts:
    2:22 │ references UsersController
```

## A Violation, Traced

Given `models.cannot_use :controllers` and this file:

```ruby
class User
  def profile_path = UsersController
end
```
{: data-title="app/models/user.rb"}

Rubydex resolves a `references_constant` edge from `app/models/user.rb` to
`UsersController`. Component assignment puts the file in `models` and puts
`UsersController` (defined in `app/controllers`) in `controllers`. The
`dependencies.forbid` rule walks dependency edges from `models`, resolves
`UsersController` the way Ruby would, innermost namespace outward, finds
it lands in a forbidden component, and emits:

```text
[error] models must not depend on controllers [dependencies.forbid]

app/models/user.rb:2:22

    1 │ class User
  → 2 │   def profile_path = UsersController
      │                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    3 │ end

  note: User references UsersController
```

## Dynamic Code

Static analysis cannot see through `send`, `const_get`, or `method_missing`.
ArchSpec records these as `dynamic_feature` facts with confidence
`unknown_due_to_dynamic_feature` instead of ignoring them, and every
diagnostic carries the evidence it was derived from, so you can verify a
report against the source line it points to.

Because checks only index code and never load it, they need no Rails
boot, no database, and have no side effects. They are safe to run in CI, in
a git hook, or after an AI-assisted change.
