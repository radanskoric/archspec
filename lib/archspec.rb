# ArchSpec turns your application's architecture into executable checks.
#
# You describe components, dependencies, and boundaries in an +Archspec.rb+
# file written in the ArchSpec::DSL, then run <tt>archspec check</tt> to verify
# every change. ArchSpec indexes Ruby source with Rubydex, uses Prism for a
# handful of syntax-specific facts, and never boots the app during checks.
# The opt-in <tt>archspec reflect</tt> command boots Rails separately to
# capture resolved association facts for later static checks.
#
# The DSL is the public API. An +Archspec.rb+ file is evaluated directly:
#
#   architecture :rails
#
#   component :services, in: "app/services/**/*.rb"
#   services.cannot_call :render, :redirect_to, receiver: :none
#
# See ArchSpec::DSL::Context for the top-level DSL and
# ArchSpec::DSL::ComponentProxy for per-component rules. See
# ArchSpec::Architectures for the bundled architecture presets.
#
# You can also build a definition in plain Ruby with ArchSpec.define.
module ArchSpec
  class << self
    # Builds an architecture definition from a block of DSL calls.
    #
    #   ArchSpec.define do
    #     component :models, in: "app/models/**/*.rb"
    #     component :controllers, in: "app/controllers/**/*.rb"
    #     models.cannot_use :controllers
    #   end
    #
    # An +Archspec.rb+ file is not written with this wrapper. Its top level is
    # already the DSL, so bare +component+ and +architecture+ calls work
    # directly. Use +define+ when constructing a definition from Ruby, such as
    # in a test.
    #
    # Returns the ArchSpec::Definition.

      definition = Definition.new(name)
